Yet another type of variables
1) Local ///
2) instance variable
3)static variable:
local variable that is declared inside the method or a block like while loop for loop if condition
or inside the constructor are called local variables.
properties of local variables.
1)we cant access them outsise of the block
for example
if(2>1){
int x=10 // this variable will not be accessible outside of the // curly brackets of it condition
}
x=20 CE
2) as soon as we are done with the method these local variables are destroyed and memory is(RAM)
freed and is available to be used by other programs which means they are very efficiant in
managing the memory thats why they are always recommended over instance variables.
instance variable:
All of the variables which are declared outside of the method blocks
or constructors but inside a class are called a instance variable.
Properties:

1)memory is allocated inside RAM as soon as a object of that class is created and it says
in the memory unless we are done with the closing brackets.
2)they are highly discouraged because they are not efficent in handeling memory( RAM).

static variables:
They are declared outside of the methods, constructors and block of codes with static keywords

Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are just keywords (Private public protected) that help reduce the visabilityof our
variables and methods so that no one else from other classes or packages can modify our data.
private.
If we use private access modifier with our variables or mthods we can only access that variable from the same class

class account{
private int balance{
void depositMoney(){
if(boolean properChannel,int,money){
balance=balance+money
}
}
}
class hacker{
balance=100000;//CE Cannot access
}
Default:
This is not a keyword its a behaviour which is assigned to the methods or properties automatically
if we are not assigning any access modifier

package1
class{
String car;
}
package2
class family{
car="I am your little brother I am using your car today forgive if I destroy it"
}
if we dont specify any modifiers default behavior will be assigned to our variables and
methods and they will only be availble within same package.

Public
if we declare our methods or instance variables we can access them from any where any package any class.
