Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java through which we can use the fields and methods
from one class to the other without writing a single line of code / repeating the code
from the class from whic we are inheriting.
Benefits of using inhertance:
1)Cleaner more efficient code for memory and execution.
2) It helps us reduce duplicate code
3)saves time
4)reusing the same code again.
Disadvantages:
Classes are tightly coupled changes in parent class effect child class
Class Parent{

int Money;
void print()
sout"Money="+Money
}
}
}
class Child extends Parents{
main(){
Child child =new Child()
child.print

}
}
we can access our static fields and method using class names and using objects
of the class but using Class name is preferable because Static methods and fields b
belong to class not to objects
