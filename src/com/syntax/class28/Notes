Abstraction:
is a process of showing the funcionality
to the user and hiding the implementation details.
we can achieve the abstrsction in Java in two ways
1) Abstract classes and other one is Interfaces
Abstract classes can have abstract methods we can implent those abstract methods in our child classes.
Rules to Follow:
We can have as many abstract methods as we want in a class.
1) Declare an abstract we can use abstract keyword
2)
We cant have abstract methods as private because they will never be
inherited and will not able to provide implementation for those
2)same way we cant declare our methods as final because final methods can never be over
abstract class ParentClass{

public static
}
