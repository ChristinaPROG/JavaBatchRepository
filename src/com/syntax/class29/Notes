Interfaces
Its a mechanism to achive abstraction in Java. We can achieve %100
Abstraction and multiple inheritance using interfaces.
We use interface when we know nothing about implementation and we only know
about functionality.
1) An interface have all the fields as public static final by default
and we cant create instance fields why because we cant create an object of interface
If we try to declare the fields as anything other then public static or final we will get a error.
They are widely used to store lambdas in java.
2)An interface can have static method, default method and abstract method
3)Any class who implements the interface has to provide the implementation for the abstract method or we
can delare that class as abstract.
